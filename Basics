# Python Basics

Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. This section covers the foundational concepts of Python programming.

### Topics Covered

1. Variables and Data Types
2. Input and Output
3. Basic Operators
4. Conditional Statements

### Variables and Data Types
Variables are used to store data in Python. Python supports various data types such as integers, floats, strings, and booleans.

```python
# Example
x = 5       # Integer
y = 3.14    # Float
name = "John"  # String
is_student = True  # Boolean
```

### Input and Output
Python allows easy interaction with users through input and output functions.

```python
# Example
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", name)
```

### Basic Operators
Python supports arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.

```python
# Example
x = 10
y = 3
print(x + y)  # Addition
print(x > y)  # Comparison
```

### Conditional Statements
Python uses `if`, `elif`, and `else` for decision-making.

```python
# Example
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
elif x == 5:
    print("x is 5")
else:
    print("x is less than 5")
